Notification Seen/Unseen Indicator in Jetpack Compose

This repository contains the code for a notification feature that lets users know whether they have seen a notification or not. The feature is designed to improve user experience by providing a visual cue that helps users keep track of their notifications. When a new notification arrives, it is marked as "unseen." Once the user views the notification, it is marked as "seen." The status indicator is visible within the app's notification system, making it easy for users to quickly identify which notifications they have viewed and which ones still require their attention.

The following screenshots provide a glimpse into the app's features and functionality.
